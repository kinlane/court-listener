The Free Law Project Court Opinion API is a very cool project. I like how the information was gathered, aggregated, cleaned up and delivered via an API.  I think it is a model to follow when approaching other government open data projects.

I needed a working project area to house any work I do around the Free Law Project Court Opinion API, so I setup this Github repository. I'm starting with an API definition for the API, but will soon publish other tooling around API.

The Free Law Project Court Opinion API is a dataset that is public commons, opening up the opportunity for innovation around not just building applications on the API, but evolving the overall API into something that can be used by numerous groups.

As I work on each project, I will tell the story here on the project blog.
