<h1>Free Law Project - Court Opinion API</h1>
<p>This is a working project to show was is possibile with the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest-info/" target="_blank">Free Law Project's Court Opinion API</a>.</p> 
<p>I'm working on a Swagger API definition for the API, as well as server and client side tooling in a variety of lagnuages. I will also create implementations that run on AWS and OpenShift.</p>
<p>Currently this runs through an API proxy at court.listener.api.publicprivatesector.org so I can use CORS, I'm also using API keys instead of Basic Auth so I can provide analytics on usage, you can register over at <a href="https://apievangelist.3scale.net/">API Evangelist API</a>. The API is not listed in documentation, but the keys you are issued will work.</p>
